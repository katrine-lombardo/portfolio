          <p className='my-2'>Hi, I'm Katrine!</p>
          <p>
            I'm a recent Hack Reactor coding bootcamp graduate and seasoned
            workplace leader with a passion for problem-solving.
          </p>
          <p className='my-2'>
            I aim to use cutting-edge technology for innovative problem-solving
            and actively promote diversity in the tech industry. With a strong
            work ethic and a multicultural background (born in Scotland,
            Norwegian as my first language), I see myself as a bridge-builder
            connecting ideas, people, and solutions.
          </p>
          <p className='my-2'>
            In my 10-year HR journey at tech startups, I've demonstrated
            determination, loyalty, and humor, refining skills in data and
            systems. I've been told I bring a "special sauce" of resilience,
            continuous growth, humour, and authenticity.
          </p>
          <p className='my-2'>
            Excited to connect, collaborate, and contribute to the ever-evolving
            landscape of technology! ðŸš€
